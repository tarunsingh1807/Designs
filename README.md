# Designs
A repository for all my design works I have done so far.
I am an engineer turning UI UX designer and my sole purpose is to translate innovative ideas into an effective design.
I am passionate about my work, who is always curious to know about new things that can be implemented in the designs so as to make it more realistic and effective.I am very professional towards what I do and do it by heart!! 

I have previously interned at an Information Technology & Services organisation and I have made few projects that include various website designs, APP designs.
So i believe that I have a strong chance to be selected for this role. And I can assure that I'll try my best to prove my worth.
